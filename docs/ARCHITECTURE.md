# Architecture

GitHub Reminders is intentionally designed as a small, repository-native GitHub Action.

## V1 design

```text
issue/PR comment
  -> issue_comment workflow
  -> command parser
  -> confirmation comment + hidden reminder metadata
  -> scheduled workflow scan
  -> due reminder detection
  -> idempotent delivery marker
  -> reminder comment mentioning creator
```

## Storage

V1 uses GitHub issue and pull-request comments as the durable reminder store. No external database is required.

The hidden marker is versioned so future releases can evolve the format deliberately rather than silently reinterpret historical reminder data.

## Reliability

Delivery is at-least-once at the scheduler boundary, with an idempotency marker used to avoid intentional duplicate reminder comments after partial workflow failures.

GitHub Actions scheduling is not real-time. The Action therefore makes no deadline-grade delivery guarantee.

## Security boundary

The Action uses the repository-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` and requires only:

- read access to contents;
- write access to issue comments;
- write access to pull-request comments.

V1 has no external network dependency beyond GitHub's own API, no runtime npm dependencies, no credential store, and no hosted control plane.

## Project principles

1. Free and open source.
2. Minimal permissions.
3. No mandatory hosted backend.
4. No user tracking or advertising.
5. No unnecessary dependencies.
6. Preserve understandable repository-local behavior.
7. Add complexity only when a real use case justifies it.
